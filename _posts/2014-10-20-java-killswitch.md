## Update-me-now killswitch in Java 7

After Java 7 update 17 Sun/Oracle implemented a kill switch which prevents installed java working after compiled in specific date (roughly 3 months after release) displaing prompts ala

"This version of Java is not secure"

While it is usual to read every week announcements about new exploits in Java this sort of self punishment is very inconvenient in Corporate (aka no internet) environments.

There is a whole thread dedicated to prevent Java to display various Update me dialogs

[http://www.symantec.com/connect/forums/how-everyone-addressing-forced-java-dialog-java-update-needed-your-java-version-insecure](http://www.symantec.com/connect/forums/how-everyone-addressing-forced-java-dialog-java-update-needed-your-java-version-insecure)

Of cource you must update Java, but all this prompts in Corporate environment is pointless because user does not have enough rights to Update java.
