## Moving from technical expertise to nice visual appearance

Nowdays almost every piece of technology, published on Github or elsewhere is accompanied by visually appealing startup page with custom domain, nice urls, responsible design and such.

Or by custom made image at least.

Do you remember when best OSS projects were on bare-content websites?

Pepperridge farm remembers.

While it is nice to see this trend, it can be difficult to aprehend true maturity or effectiveness of proposed solution. Looking at good design you might think "Wow, great project!" and only much later realise the project have bad code decisions, can`t be easily extended or modified.

For example, [linux-dash](https://github.com/afaqurk/linux-dash) hosted on github.
It looks good, but try adding custom module yourselves (I`ve tried - you must make changes in 4 files).
