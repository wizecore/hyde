## Strategic planning is dead

Imagine average meetings with uncompfrehencible charts and vague ideas like "we must increase salees by 20%"?

It's a thing of the past. While you are accustomed to idea to think not only What? but also Why? and How? on such meetings, the main trend is real technical breakdown of ideas and plans.

Thanks to Apple, Google and other "all-in-the-ears" tech companies, your board of directors full of high paying people who dont know how to program a microwave is like a crypto with mummies.
You must be tech savvy, go down on all details and be aligned with execution staff to have things go really well.
