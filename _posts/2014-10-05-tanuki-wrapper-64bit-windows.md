title: 64-bit Windows binary of Tanuki Software Wrapper
---

On original site where is no way to download 64 bit version for Windows.

One, ofc, can compile it manually but you can save yourself a lot of hassle just getting the binary.

Today I discovered that OSS project Apache ActiveMQ binary distribution bundles win64 binaries with it.

So grab it from http://activemq.apache.org if you need win64 wrapper binaries.
